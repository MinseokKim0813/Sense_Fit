# Sense Fit

## Set up
You will need to create a virtual environment for python libraries:

First, move to the root of the repository on terminal.

on macOS
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
Make sure you get (.venv) in front of your terminal prompt.

Next, install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, we can finally run the GUI:
```
python3 main.py
```
